          "Point to note: is that I got this to use with Ubuntu Linux (no microsoft) and it's working quite well. However, if you''re planning the same, note that there is a bitlocker that needs unlocking before you can update the BIOS to boot from the USB drive. This makes things a little awkward. Other than that I would recommend this.",
